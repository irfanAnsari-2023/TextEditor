## Technical Details

The application is written in Java and uses object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism. It also makes use of file input/output to read and write text files.

## Requirements

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
An integrated development environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans.
A basic understanding of Java programming concepts such as classes, objects, and methods.

## Features

- Create new text files.
- Open existing text files.
- Edit the contents of a text file.
- Save changes made to a text file.
- Delete a text file.

## Usage

To start the application, run the Main class.
- Choose one of the options from the menu:
- Create new file: This option creates a new text file and allows you to enter the text to be saved in the file.
- Edit existing file: This option allows you to edit an existing text file by entering the filename and editing the text.
- Save file: This option saves the changes made to the file.
- Delete file: This option deletes a file from the system.
- Exit: This option exits the application.

## Code Explanation

The Text Editor project is implemented using the following classes:

- Main Class
This class contains the main method of the application. It displays a menu with different options to the user and calls the appropriate method based on the user's choice.

- FileHandler Class
This class handles all the file I/O operations in the application. It has methods to create, edit, save, and delete text files.

- UserInput Class
This class is responsible for getting user input from the console. It has methods to get the filename and text input from the user.

Conclusion
The Text Editor project is a simple yet useful application that demonstrates the use of file I/O in Java. It can be further improved by adding more features such as search and replace, syntax highlighting, and more.

## Future Improvements

Add support for additional file types such as HTML, XML, and CSV.
Implement a search feature to find specific text within a file.
Allow users to change the font size and style of the text editor window.
